(Wall's centerline, center of core, and faces of core)\r\nAlso works with linked walls.\r\nPlease note : Results are reversed for flipped walls, Wall's Elevation Profile - Obtains the curves which bound the wall's elevation profile.\r\nOnly works with a wall whose profile has been edited., Workset By Name - Retrieves the workset by the given name., Print Settings Properties - Returns the name, paper size, orientation, placement, zoom and colors of the given or collected print settings., Copy DWFMarkup Symbol to View - Place a family instance from the location of the Markup symbol for the given or active sheet.\r\nPlease note : A family type with a name similar to that of the markup symbol (label) should be loaded into the document., Get Flipped Element - Gets the flipped wall, hand flipped (hinge side) and facing flipped (interior wall side) doors., Copy DWFMarkup Curve to View - Copies the line, polyline and ellipse from the Markup objects for the given or active sheet.\r\nPlease note that markups are found by name (label) and therefore depend on the Revit localization (language)., Copy DWFMarkup RevisionCloud to View - Copies the revision cloud from the Markup objects for the given or active sheet.\r\nAlso copies the markup notes to the comments of the created revision cloud.\r\nPlease note that markups are found by name (label) and therefore depend on the Revit localization (language)., Copy DWFMarkup TextNote to View - Copies the text note from the Markup objects for the given or active sheet.\r\nPlease note that markups are found by name (label) and therefore depend on the Revit localization (language)., Link DWF - Link DWF in given sheet.\r\nThis API method doesn't work with DWF containing multiple sheets.","engine_version":"2.0.3.8811","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"https://forum.dynamobim.com/u/Alban_de_Chasteigner","repository_url":"","contains_binaries":true,"node_libraries":["GeniusLoci, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null","itextsharp, Version=5.5.10.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=8354ae6d2174ddca","Package.customization, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"]}
