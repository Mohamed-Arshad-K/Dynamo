             method for generating tabs on the unfolded surfaces, this method will generate tabs on all
             shared edges that were not folded, but only one of each pair. For example, if unfolding a cube,
             the corner edges that were split will only have tabs generated on one of the final resulting surface
             edges. This single edge in the cube becomes two edges in the unfold, and only one is tabbed.

            This method exposes the tessellation algorithm that is used to display 
            geometry in Dynamo's watch3d and background preview displays as a node.
            It is possible this node and all dependent code in the unfolding library
            will be replaced by faster triangle representation that does not require
            conversion to a surface.
