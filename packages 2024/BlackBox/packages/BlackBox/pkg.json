It is is a compilation of nodes that have been built for specific project needs. I find them helpful both in our process and to help teach basic/advanced Dynamo and basic Revit API.

I made the Elements as a input so that this can be used across linked files, Collector.RoomFromElements - Feed elements into this node and get the Rooms they are in. This uses the Revit API property of Room that each elemant inherits. , Get.CategoryName - Get the category of an element, Get.CurtainPanelByLevel - Select curtain panels by the level they are on. These panels will look to the wall they are hosted in and use the Base Constraint. This hurdles the difficulties in door and windows not reading the level corectly., Get.ElevationsWithoutMarker - No description provided, Get.FamilyName - Get the Famiily Name of an Element, Get.FlippedWall - This node creates two lists of walls, one in which the wall has been flipped from original position and on that has not been.  It is useful in Curtain Walls that have complicated Curtain Panels, Get.Host - get the host of am element, Get.NestedFamily - This node uses the SuperComponent and SubComponets properties of Revit API to organize the elements into lists based on there make-up. I haven't tested multiple nested families but have found it helpfull esp. on Doors, Plumbing Fixtures, & Casework to find out which family is nested in which parent, PointCloud.CreateFilter - No description provided, PointCloud.GetInstance - No description provided, PointCloud.ReadPoints - No description provided, PointCloud.ToDynamoPoints - No description provided","engine_version":"0.9.2.4472","engine":"dynamo","engine_metadata":"","site_url":"www.serialnonstandard.com","repository_url":"","contains_binaries":false,"node_libraries":[]}
